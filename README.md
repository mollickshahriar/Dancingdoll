# Dancingdoll
Dancing Doll Project by OpenGL Platform.It is expected that the standard output device, which is the monitor, is capable of supporting color. Consider the following: assumptions and dependencies. It is necessary for the user's machine to have the C++ compiler installed in the right versions.
The purpose of this project is to use animation to explain the operation in classroom
environment.This project maintain Two separate class-based composite objects that each
consist of a parent with no geometry, that each have at least 8 attached child objects with
geometry, and that each have at least one animation methods that animate some property of
child objects, such as position, orientation, or scale. The child objects directly attached to the
parent, or they attached indirectly via other child objects. Each class override the hide & show
methods so that hide and show calls sent to the composite object are passed to all child objects. Child objects has not hidden inside an object such that they are not visible. This project
composite objects must real, recognisable things (such as people, robots, cars, machines, buildings, etc.). That are not be arbitrary collections of shapes. This project’s two composite
objects are looking significantly different to each other and independent of each other. Each composite object must have at least 2 independently animatable children. The animation
capability of the child components exposed through animation methods in each composite
object. This project’s composite objects from your own creation.
